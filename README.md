HW 1:-

1.	what is the difference between waterfall and agile? Which one do you prefer?
•	The main advantage is the backward scalability in Agile, In waterfall we cannot change decisions & implementations that we had made in previous stages.
If want to make changes, we will have to build the entire project from the scratch once angain.
•	Flexibility of error check under any part of the development is possible in Agile methodology.
Where as in waterfall, test can be possible at the end of the development module.

Since Agile provides flexibility to make changes as per customers requirement, I would prefer Agile towards customer satisfaction.
